Simple Version: Using a VPN to Secure Remote Access

Choose a Strong VPN

Use a trusted, secure VPN system like IPsec or OpenVPN.

Use Strong Encryption

Protect data with strong encryption (like AES-256).

Use secure keys and modern TLS versions.

Require Strong Login Security

Use multi-factor authentication (MFA).

Make sure every employee has their own login.

Allow Only Safe Devices

Only let devices connect if they are updated and secure.

Check for latest patches and antivirus.

Limit What Users Can Access

Give employees access only to what they need.

Block direct access to sensitive servers.

Monitor and Log Activity

Record all login attempts.

Watch for unusual behavior (odd locations, late-night logins, big data transfers).

Send All Traffic Through the VPN

Use full-tunnel mode so everything goes through the secure connection.

Keep VPN Software Updated

Install updates and security patches.

Refresh keys and certificates regularly.

Check for VPN Leaks

Make sure no IP, DNS, or data leaks happen outside the VPN.
