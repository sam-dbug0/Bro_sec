Using a VPN to Secure Remote Access (Simple Version)
1. Choose a Strong VPN

Use trusted VPN technologies like IPsec or OpenVPN.

2. Use Strong Encryption

Encrypt data using AES-256.

Use secure keys and modern TLS versions.

3. Require Strong Login Security

Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA).

Make sure each employee has a unique login.

4. Allow Only Safe Devices

Only allow devices that are updated and secure.

Check for latest OS patches and antivirus software.

5. Limit What Users Can Access

Provide access only to necessary resources.

Block direct access to sensitive internal servers.

6. Monitor and Log Activity

Record all login attempts.

Watch for unusual behavior (example: new locations, late-night logins, large transfers).

7. Send All Traffic Through the VPN

Use full-tunnel mode so all internet traffic goes through the VPN.

8. Keep VPN Software Updated

Install security patches and updates regularly.

Refresh keys and certificates on schedule.

9. Check for VPN Leaks

Make sure there are no IP leaks, DNS leaks, or traffic leaks outside the tunnel.





Scenario 1: Securing a Company’s Sensitive Data (CIA Triad)
1. Ensuring Confidentiality
- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts.
- Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all critical systems.
- Encrypt all data:
* At rest: AES-256
* In transit: TLS 1.3
- Enforce the Principle of Least Privilege using RBAC.
- Deploy Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools to prevent unauthorized data movement.
- Implement network segmentation (e.g., separate VLANs for Finance, HR, Development).
2. Ensuring Integrity
- Use File Integrity Monitoring tools (Tripwire, OSSEC).
- Maintain version control and apply formal change-control processes.
- Apply digital signatures to critical or sensitive documents.
- Use checksums and hashing (e.g., SHA-256) for backups and file validation.
- Implement audit logs with tamper protection and secure storage.
3. Ensuring Availability
- Create regular backups with off-site and cloud storage options.
- Use redundant systems (RAID arrays, load balancers, failover servers).
- Establish Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity Plans (BCP).
- Use UPS/generators for power redundancy during outages.
- Deploy firewalls, IDS/IPS, and DDoS protection to maintain service uptime.
