Scenario 1: A company needs to secure its online transactions. Describe how you would implement HTTPS and TLS to achieve this.

1. Obtain a valid CA-signed SSL/TLS certificate.
   - Use a trusted Certificate Authority (DigiCert, GlobalSign, Let's Encrypt).

2. Configure the server for modern TLS.
   - Enable only TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3.
   - Disable SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS 1.0, and TLS 1.1.
   - Use strong cipher suites (AES-256-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305).

3. Enable Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).
   - Use ECDHE for key exchange.

4. Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
   - Enable HSTS to prevent downgrade attacks.

5. Secure key management.
   - Protect the private key with strict permissions.
   - Rotate keys and certificates when needed.

6. Enable certificate lifecycle management.
   - Monitor expiration dates.
   - Revoke or replace compromised certificates.

7. Test the configuration using SSL Labs or similar tools.
   - Ensure an A or A+ grade.


Scenario 2: How would you identify and mitigate SSL/TLS vulnerabilities in a web application?

Identification:
1. Use TLS scanning tools:
   - SSL Labs Server Test
   - Nmap (ssl-enum-ciphers)
   - OpenSSL tests
   - Nessus or OpenVAS

2. Look for:
   - Weak protocols (SSL, TLS 1.0)
   - Weak ciphers (RC4, 3DES)
   - Certificate problems (expired, self-signed, wrong hostname)
   - Missing HSTS
   - Lack of PFS
   - Known vulnerabilities (Heartbleed, POODLE, BEAST, ROBOT)

Mitigation:
1. Disable weak protocols: SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1.
2. Remove weak cipher suites: RC4, DES/3DES, export-grade ciphers.
3. Enable modern secure ciphers: AES-GCM, ChaCha20, ECDHE.
4. Fix certificate issues:
   - Ensure valid CA-signed certificates
   - Correct domain names
   - Include intermediate certificates
5. Enable HSTS and OCSP stapling.
6. Ensure Perfect Forward Secrecy (ECDHE).
7. Update TLS libraries (OpenSSL, nginx, Apache).
8. Continuously monitor with automated TLS scans.
